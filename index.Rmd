### Table of average **arrival** delays by destination:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(arr_delay_by_dest)
```

### Table of average **departure** delays by month:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(dep_delay_by_month)
```


### Plot of departure delays by month
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
plot(dep_delay_by_month)
```

According to the dataset, month `r max_avg_dep_delay` had the greatest
